cp config.sample.js config.js  # the config.js file must exist

make ENV=CORPORATE=1 develop
```

## styling

There is a top-level [`.prettierrc`](/.prettierrc) file for the [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) formatter.

For `uc-doc` Markdown documents, the command `yarn format:uc-doc` should be used (and will be checked by CI).

```shell
make ENV=CORPORATE=1 build
```

The documentation is built in the `public/` folder, you can then run a simple HTTP server:

```shell
cd public/
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your favorite browser.
